## Recipe application with custom recipe uploads ðŸ‘Œ

Using only Vanilla JavaScript (no frontend frameworks) to create this recipe application was for me an opportunity to put into practice all what I learnt in a JavaScript course such as:

- Arrays' methods
- DOM and events
- Classes
- Modules
- Asynchronous Javascript: Promises, Async/await, and AJAX
- Bundling with Parcel and npm scripts
- ...
