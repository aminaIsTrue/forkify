## Recipe application with custom recipe uploads

Using only Vanilla JavaScript (no frontend frameworks) to create this recipe application was for me an opportunity to put into practice all what I learnt in a JavaScript course such as:
o Arrays' methods
o DOM and events
o Classes
o Modules
o Asynchronous Javascript: Promises, Async/await, and AJAX
o Bundling with Parcel and npm scripts
